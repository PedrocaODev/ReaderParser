## Purpose

Defines how chapter downloads are enqueued from the reader and series screens, including single-chapter and batch download modes, duplicate prevention, and queue management.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Enqueue single chapter download

The system SHALL allow the user to enqueue a single chapter for download from the unified Reader screen or the series detail screen. The chapter SHALL be inserted into the download queue with state QUEUED and SHALL be processed by `ChapterDownloadWorker`, independent of whether its content type is NOVEL or MANHWA.

#### Scenario: Enqueue novel from unified Reader

- **WHEN** the user taps Download for a NOVEL chapter in the unified Reader
- **THEN** the chapter SHALL be added to the download queue with state QUEUED
- **AND** a `ChapterDownloadWorker` work request SHALL be enqueued for that chapter

#### Scenario: Enqueue manhwa from unified Reader

- **WHEN** the user taps Download for a MANHWA chapter in the unified Reader
- **THEN** the chapter SHALL be added to the download queue with state QUEUED
- **AND** a `ChapterDownloadWorker` work request SHALL be enqueued for that chapter

#### Scenario: Enqueue from series detail

- **WHEN** the user enqueues one chapter from the series detail screen
- **THEN** the chapter SHALL be added to the download queue with state QUEUED
- **AND** a `ChapterDownloadWorker` work request SHALL be enqueued for that chapter

#### Scenario: Duplicate enqueue is ignored

- **WHEN** the user enqueues a chapter that is already QUEUED or RUNNING
- **THEN** the existing queue entry SHALL be preserved unchanged
- **AND** no duplicate work request SHALL be created

### Requirement: Enqueue batch download for a series

The system SHALL allow the user to enqueue a batch download for multiple
chapters of a series. The batch SHALL support two modes: unread-only (all
chapters not yet marked read) and user-specified range (start and end chapter
inclusive).

#### Scenario: Enqueue unread-only batch
- **WHEN** the user selects "Download unread" on the series detail screen
- **THEN** all chapters in the series where `read = false` SHALL be added to
  the download queue in chapter-number order
- **AND** each chapter SHALL have a `ChapterDownloadWorker` work request
  enqueued

#### Scenario: Enqueue range batch
- **WHEN** the user selects a start chapter and end chapter on the series
  detail screen and confirms download
- **THEN** all chapters from start through end (inclusive, ordered by chapter
  number) SHALL be added to the download queue
- **AND** each chapter SHALL have a `ChapterDownloadWorker` work request
  enqueued

#### Scenario: Empty batch
- **WHEN** the user selects "Download unread" and all chapters are already
  read
- **THEN** no items are added to the queue
- **AND** the user sees a brief message indicating nothing to download

### Requirement: Sequential execution

Downloads SHALL execute one chapter at a time. WorkManager SHALL process
`ChapterDownloadWorker` requests sequentially; the next chapter download SHALL
not start until the previous one completes, fails permanently, or is cancelled.

#### Scenario: Sequential processing
- **WHEN** multiple chapters are enqueued as a batch
- **THEN** only one `ChapterDownloadWorker` SHALL execute at a time
- **AND** the next chapter's worker SHALL start after the current one finishes

### Requirement: Cancel batch download

The system SHALL allow the user to cancel an in-progress batch download.
Canceling SHALL remove all QUEUED items for that batch from the download queue
and SHALL cancel the active worker if it belongs to that batch.

#### Scenario: Cancel active batch
- **WHEN** the user cancels a batch while a chapter from that batch is RUNNING
- **THEN** the RUNNING chapter's worker SHALL be cancelled
- **AND** all QUEUED chapters belonging to the same batch SHALL be removed
  from the download queue

#### Scenario: Cancel batch with only queued items
- **WHEN** the user cancels a batch and no chapter from that batch is
  currently RUNNING
- **THEN** all QUEUED chapters belonging to that batch SHALL be removed from
  the download queue

### Requirement: Download progress visibility

The Downloads screen SHALL display the current state (QUEUED, RUNNING,
COMPLETED, FAILED) and progress (0.0–1.0) for each enqueued chapter, along
with the series title and chapter name. When state is RUNNING and progress
is greater than 0, the status badge SHALL show the progress percentage.

#### Scenario: Observe queue updates
- **WHEN** the download queue changes (item added, state updated, item
  removed)
- **THEN** the Downloads screen SHALL reflect the updated queue in real time

#### Scenario: Progress percentage display
- **WHEN** a download item has state RUNNING and progress > 0
- **THEN** the status badge SHALL show the progress percentage (e.g., "45%")
